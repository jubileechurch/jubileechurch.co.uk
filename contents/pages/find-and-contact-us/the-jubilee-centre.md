The Jubilee Centre was opened in November 2004, following a £465,000 redevelopment programme funded almost entirely by the members of Jubilee Church. It was built on the grounds of the old mission, which was in a state of disrepair and had to be demolished (read more in our history).

The centre is the focal point for many of the activities of Jubilee Church and was purpose built for serving the local community in and around the Southlands Road area.

The two-storey building was constructed using innovative developments in building design and maximised the square footage available.

From the small mission hall which provided a home for Belmont Mission for many years, the Jubilee Centre now features a 150 seat auditorium, three large separate activity rooms (each with a capacity of 20 seats), a fully fitted industrial standard kitchen, modern audio visual equipment, full disabled access (including a lift to the first floor), ladies and gents facilities and two open-plan lobby areas.
