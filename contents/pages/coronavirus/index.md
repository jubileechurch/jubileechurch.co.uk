__A message from Jubilee Church:__ 
 
Hello!  

Sorry you can’t visit us in person, but it’s lovely of you to visit our website. Our building may be closed, but we are still being church! 
Please read on for ways you can still connect with us and other useful information. 

## Sunday Services  
Our Sunday Service has moved online, you can join us live on our Facebook page every Sunday morning from 10am. You do not need a Facebook account to watch it: [www.facebook.com/jubileechurchbromley](https://www.facebook.com/jubileechurchbromley) 


## Families
**Mosaic Morning** Please email [jess@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:jess@jubileechurch.co.uk) if you would like to be added to our mailing list for online events and activities. 

**Together At Home** For activities to do at home, our children’s worker, Jessica-Ann Jenner, has created a website of resources which are currently being used by families around the world: [www.tath.co.uk](https://www.tath.co.uk)

**Little Stars toddler group** Please visit our Facebook page [www.facebook.com/littlestarsbromley](https://www.facebook.com/littlestarsbromley) for updates and song time videos. 

## Other events and information
Recess youth club has moved online, as have many of our other small groups and activities. We are supporting each other and the wider community with prayer and practical help where we can. 

## Useful Resources
**Local Food sources**
If you are in need of food, there are a number of food projects across the borough of Bromley, that can help. You can find more information about them on the [Council website](https://www.bromley.gov.uk/info/200050/help_for_adults/1432/coronavirus_covid_19_-_accessing_food_and_shopping/2). As a church we are working with many of these projects to help source additional food, so that they can help more people.

**Debt help**
We are founder members of the CAP Bromley Partnership running the CAP Bromley Debt Centre. If you are worried about your debt, please contact [Christians Against Poverty](https://capuk.org/i-want-help).

**Care for the Family**
There are a number of online events on the [Care for the Family](https://www.careforthefamily.org.uk/events/events-online-2) website that may be helpful. This national charity aims to promote strong family life and to help those who face family difficulties, e.g. with marriage, parenting and bereavement.
 
**Mental health and wellbeing**
Taking care of our mental health and wellbeing is always important, and especially during challenging times like this when there are more concerns, changes and worries that we have to manage in our lives. It’s good to know that we can share these with God, and our church family, and pray together. There are also lots of resources available, including:

+ National charities, [Samaritans](https://www.samaritans.org/) and [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/), have helplines and useful tools to help you.
+ The NHS has a [‘coronavirus and wellbeing’](https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/) section on their website with tips and advice.
+ [Kintsugi Hope](https://www.kintsugihope.com/events), founded by Patrick Regan, is hosting online wellbeing groups. We hope to run a group in the new year.
+ The Church of England has a [mental health reflections booklet](https://www.churchofengland.org/faith-action/mental-health-resources/supporting-good-mental-health) available to download.
+ Rethink Mental Illness also has a special [COVID-19 support section](https://www.rethink.org/advice-and-information/covid-19-support/) on the website.
+ Young Minds has COVID-19 mental health support specifically for [young people](https://youngminds.org.uk/find-help/looking-after-yourself/coronavirus-and-mental-health/), and for [parents](https://youngminds.org.uk/find-help/for-parents/supporting-your-child-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/) who are supporting their children too.
  
**Christian social action**
If you want to explore more about what is happening around the world and guidance for prayers, why not take a look at the prayer sections on some of these Christian charity websites: [Tearfund](https://www.tearfund.org/en/about_you/pray/), [Christian Aid](https://www.christianaid.org.uk/pray), [Youth with a Mission (YWAM)](https://ywam.org/get-involved-now/pray/), [Operation Mobilisation (OM)](https://www.uk.om.org/Blogs/stories), [Release International](https://releaseinternational.org/) and [Open Doors](https://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/churches/)
