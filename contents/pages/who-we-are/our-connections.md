Relationships are important to us, and that includes links with other organisations that we are part of or choose to support. Here are some of the key connections we have, locally and nationally.

### Bromley Common Churches Together
We have developed good links with other churches in and around the local area and are part of Bromley Common Churches Together. This involves regular meetings throughout the year where leaders of the churches share together and pray for our local community. We also hold joint services every now and again, where members of all churches meet together in one place to worship God.

### Transform Bromley Borough
Jubilee Church have a growing friendship and relationship with a number of churches across Bromley who believe that God’s favour is upon those who "dwell together in unity". We come from different backgrounds, we hold a variety of views and opinions and often have different styles of doing church but, we share a common vision of wanting to see the love, grace & power of Jesus shared and released with the whole community across the whole of the borough of Bromley. We seek to connect on the basis of friendship and shared lives and, no matter how good or effective we may be as individual churches, we believe that we can do more together to proclaim and demonstrate the good news of Jesus than we can on our own, so we choose to be together.  Churches that are relating in this way include [Bromley Common Baptist](http://www.bromleycommonbaptist.org.uk/welcome.htm), [Bromley Town Church](http://bromleytownchurch.com/), [Cornerstone Christian Centre](http://www.cornerstonecc.org.uk/), [Brook Lane Community Church](http://www.brooklanecommunitychurch.org.uk/), [Green Street Green Baptist Church](http://gsgbaptist.org.uk/) and Jubilee Church.

### Spinnaker
[Spinnaker](http://www.spinnaker.org) is a charity that creates opportunities for children to engage with Christianity. It operates in over 70 schools in a number of London Boroughs, including Bromley. 

Spinnaker has regular contact with over 10,000 children. Jubilee Church provides some financial support to Spinnaker, and is directly involved in its work through members of our church. One of our Core Team leaders, Steve Palmer, is a director of Spinnaker.

### Pioneer Network 
Jubilee Church is a part of the national [Pioneer network](http://www.pioneer.org.uk/) of churches established in 1985. Pioneer is a UK based group of churches committed to the sharing the good news of Jesus Christ in a non-religious way that is relevant to every sphere of society and culture.

### Evangelical Alliance
We are also part of the [Evangelical Alliance](http://www.eauk.org/), an association of churches, reaching across all denominations that uphold the fundamentals of Christianity.

### DNA
[DNA](http://www.dna-uk.org) is a course for Christians who wish to spend a year learning more about living their lives serving God, equipping people for church work, such as leadership and missionary roles. As well as providing practical experience, the course includes training sessions throughout the year. Jubilee Church supports DNA by enabling them to use the Jubilee Centre as a base for the training sessions.

## International links
Over the years, Jubilee Church has developed relationships with a number of churches and Christian organisations overseas. This includes South Africa, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia. 

We provide support financially and, where possible, on a practical level through visits to teach or help with projects. We also support one another spiritually through prayer. Here are just some our international links:

### Operation Mobilisation
Since the early 1990s, Jubilee Church has supported [Operation Mobilisation](http://www.uk.om.org), known as OM. Working in more than 100 countries, OM’s aim is to motivate and equip people to share God’s love with others all over the world. We provide financial support and pray for them regularly.

### Inter-mission Industrial Development Association
We have provided financial and prayer support for this organisation, which is based in Chennai - the largest metropolitan city in South India. 

The [Inter-mission Industrial Development Association](http://www.inter-mission.de) has 15 of its 18 branches in this city, which has a population of 8 million people in the Greater Chennai area, and focuses on giving relief and rehabilitation to people below the poverty line.
