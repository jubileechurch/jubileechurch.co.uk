As a charity, Jubilee Church relies on donations from its members and others who support our work. Church members are encouraged to commit to give what they can on a regular basis. Our treasurer, keeps our trustees and leaders informed about our financial status.

The funds we raise through donations are used to cover necessities, such as running and maintaining the Jubilee Centre, which is the main hub of our activities and we also employing our leader and children's/youth workers. We believe we are called by Jesus to give generously and the remainder of our funds are used to support a number of projects and activities in our local community, the UK and overseas. You can find out more about these elsewhere on our website.

If you would like to make a donation to support the work of Jubilee Church, please contact us directly via the Treasurer, Jubilee Church, 157 Southlands Road, Bromley, BR2 9QZ.
