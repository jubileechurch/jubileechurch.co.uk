h3 Leadership
p 
  | Jubilee Church is led by a team that is headed up by Derek Holl and
  | collectively they have responsibility for the overall vision and direction of
  | the Church.  Each member of the leadership team is committed to seeing the local
  | church growing and working together and is passionate about seeing individuals
  | empowered and released to serve the community in which we live.  Our desire is
  | for people, whoever they are and whatever their background, to encounter Jesus
  | Christ and to experience His love, grace and life for themselves.

h3 Trustees 
p 
  | The Trustees are the people responsible for the control and
  | management of a charity and who serve on its Governing Body.  Trustees have, and
  | must accept, ultimate responsibility for directing the affairs of a charity and
  | ensuring that it is solvent, well run and meeting the needs for which it has
  | been set up. (Quoted from The Charity Commission)
  
  h3 Staff
  p 
  | We are pleased to be able to employ a small team of part-team staff to support 
  | the work of the Church. Each person brings their skills to benefit children,  
  | young people and adults who are part of Jubilee Church, the local community, the  
  | wider Church across our borough and beyond. We also have many volunteers helping 
  | in many areas of church life. Our volunteer Pastoral Team Leader oversees support
  | for individuals in the church.
