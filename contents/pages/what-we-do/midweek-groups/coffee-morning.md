Every Wednesday morning, from 10.30am to 12 noon, the doors of the Jubilee Centre open to a wide range of people from our local community who come along to enjoy homemade cake, fresh fruit and nice cup of tea or coffee! A minimum donation of £1 is all that’s required and as well as the refreshments and delicious cakes on offer, the morning provides the opportunity to catch up with old friends, or meet new ones. To make sure the adults get a chance to chat, there are plenty of toys available to keep the little ones occupied. Whether you come alone or with others, you can be sure of a warm welcome and some friendly company.
