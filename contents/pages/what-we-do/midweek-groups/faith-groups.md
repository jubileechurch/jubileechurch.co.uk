Every fortnight, we meet in smaller groups called Faith Groups - For life, growth and going deeper.
These meetings usually take place at someoneâ€™s home and are held on a few different evenings or afternoons. The groups provide time to build friendships, to grow in our faith and go deeper into the bible, worship and acts of service.
