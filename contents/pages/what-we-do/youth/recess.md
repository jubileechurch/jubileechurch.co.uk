Recess is for 11-18 year olds and takes place on Friday evenings 8-10pm during term time. Want to know more? Keep reading…

 

### What happens at Recess?

Films, table tennis, pool, football, music, computer games, occasional outings to bowling, or going over to Whitehall Recreation park. Part of the evening usually includes a time of activities, competitions, or discussions based on social or moral issues and given from a Christian perspective. Occasionally we hold a lock-in where we sleep overnight at the centre and watch films, play games and chat – all ending in the morning with a cooked breakfast. You can see our latest programme of activities at on [our facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/recessbromley).

### Who is in charge?

A small team of volunteers help to run Recess and the club is led by our youth worker, all of whom are accountable to the leadership of Jubilee church.

### How much does it cost and how do I join?

It’s just £1.50 per week. Turn up and you will be given some forms to take away for your parent/guardian to fill out. Or for more information, email [recess@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:recess@jubileechurch.co.uk).

### Do I have to be a Christian or join the church?

No, while we retain the right to talk about our faith and share about God's love, we do not expect anyone who joins the club to believe in God or attend church.

### Is there a limit on numbers?

Yes, we operate on a first come, first served basis and allow up to 35 young people, between the ages of 11-18, to be there on any one night.

 

Why not come along and see if Recess is for you? Come on your own and make new friends, or come with friends – we’ll give you a warm welcome and you’ll find a fun and friendly atmosphere.
