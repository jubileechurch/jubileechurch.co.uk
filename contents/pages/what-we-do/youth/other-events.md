We join with other churches in the Bromley area and across London to worship God and learn about what it means to follow Jesus and be part of the wider church.

We regular hold joint gatherings with other local churches and have been going to [Soul Survivor](www.soulsurvivor.com/uk) since 2013. If you are interested in attending any of our events or groups, you can check upcoming dates by emailing [youthwork@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:youthwork@jubileechurch.co.uk).
