We join with other churches in the Bromley area and across London to worship God and learn about what it means to follow Jesus and be part of the wider church.

We hold a Youth Worship Event called Identity on a regular basis, are members of the monthly Youth Service at [St Augustine's church](http://www.st-augustines.org.uk/) held on a Sunday night and have been going to [Soul Survivor](http://www.soulsurvivor.com/uk) since 2013. If you are interested in attending any of these events, you can check upcoming dates by emailing [youthwork@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:youthwork@jubileechurch.co.uk).
