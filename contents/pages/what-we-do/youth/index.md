There has been a long history of youth work on the site of the [Jubilee Centre](/pages/find-and-contact-us/#the-jubilee-centre), stretching back to the 1920s!

Today there are a number of different activities and events that are available for young people. Recess is [our Friday night youth club](#recess) for any young people in the community. 4:12 is for young people that want to be part of Jubilee church, and meets [during Sunday morning meetings](#sundays). We also join with [other churches in the area](/pages/who-we-are/#our-connections) for joint services, [worship events](#identity) and going to festivals like Soul Survivor. 

We really value young people and want Jubilee Church to be a place where they are safe, encouraged and can thrive. We are committed to safeguarding practices and all our youthwork volunteers and staff have been appointed through safer recruitment. Find out more about our [safeguarding](/pages/what-we-do/Safeguarding/).
