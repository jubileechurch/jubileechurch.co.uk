Jubilee Church has employed a part-time Children’s Worker since 2009. We are currently looking to employ a new children's worker as our excellent children's worker has stepped down to look after her own young family. The children's worker role is responsible for children's work on a Sunday, [Little Stars](#little-stars) and Mosaic. 

If you want to find out more about our children's work or about the role, please contact us at <info@jubileechurch.co.uk>.
