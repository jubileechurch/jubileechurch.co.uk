Held on the **second Saturday of each month** between 10.00-11.30am at the Jubilee Centre, these sessions are for all ages and are a place for families to come and spend time together and enjoy each other’s company. 

Each month has a different theme, but there will always be a range of craft activities to try, toys to play with, a snack and story time and some fun games together.  Previous activities include baking, den building, movie mornings and once a year we create a wonderful light up window display together!

The whole morning is great fun for adults and children alike! The cost is just £3 per family, so why not come and join us! Please contact our us for more information at <jess@jubileechurch.co.uk> or to be added to our monthly mailing list.
