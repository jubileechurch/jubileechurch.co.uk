Held on the second Saturday of each month between 10.00-11.30am at the Jubilee Centre, these sessions are for all ages and are a place for families to come and spend time together and enjoy each others company.

Feedback from those attending has been really positive. Each month there is a big activity to join in with which could be cooking, baking, planting, sticking, painting or building... and we always have  a fun storytime and songtime too! 

The whole morning is great fun for adults and children alike! The cost is just Â£1 per person, so why not come and join us! Please contact our us for more information at <info@jubileechurch.co.uk>.
