Jubilee Church takes the safeguarding of children and young people very seriously and our safeguarding policy is available on request. We follow 'safer recruitment' processes and guidelines and all our trustees, leaders, staff and volunteers who work with children and/or young people have been on Safeguarding training and have undergone a Disclosure & Barring Service (DBS) check as appropriate.

If you have any concerns relating to the safeguarding of anyone who attends Jubilee Church or attends an event that Jubilee Church is organising, you should contact our safeguarding co-ordinators by emailing [safeguarding@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:safeguarding@jubileechurch.co.uk).

Alternatively, if your concerns involve a child or young person you can seek advice from [Bromley Safeguarding Children](http://www.bromley.gov.uk/info/200127/safeguarding_children/163/reporting_child_abuse) and if it involves a vulnerable adult you can seek advice from [Bromley Safeguarding Adults](http://www.bromley.gov.uk/info/731/safeguarding_adults/280/safeguarding_adults_at_risk/2)

 If a child or vulnerable adult is in immediate danger you should call 999.
