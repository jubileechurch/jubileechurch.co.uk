We really value children and want Jubilee Church to be a place where they are safe, encouraged and can thrive. We are committed to safeguarding practices and all our children's volunteers and staff have been appointed through safer recruitment. Find out more about our [safeguarding](/pages/what-we-do/Safeguarding/).
