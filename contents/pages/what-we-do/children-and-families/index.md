We really love connecting with families and want Jubilee Church to be a place where everyone feels safe and loved. We are committed to safeguarding practices and all our children's volunteers and staff have been appointed through a safer recruitment process. [More on our safeguarding practices](/pages/what-we-do/Safeguarding/).

Our children and families worker Jess can be contactedâ€¯via [jess@jubileechurch.co.uk](mailto:jess@jubileechurch.co.uk).
