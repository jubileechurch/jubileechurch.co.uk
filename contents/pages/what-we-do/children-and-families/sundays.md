We love to spend time together on a Sunday Morning and most of our services begin with all ages together in the main hall where we can worship and learn from one another.  On some Sundays we invite the children to spend time in groups learning and growing together.  We believe that children of all ages can develop their own personal relationship with God and encounter Him in their daily lives, not just on Sunday mornings. 

### Crèche (0-4 Year Olds)

A supervised crèche is available downstairs. Little ones can play together in a relaxed and fun environment as they explore a Bible story.  The creche is a space for children to feel safe, loved and connected to Father God through play, crafts, stories, songs and friendship. 

### Jubilee Kids (4-10 Year Olds)

Primary aged children are invited to gather upstairs to explore the Bible together through games, crafts, prayer and fun! Jubilee Kids provides a safe space for children to explore their personal faith and connect with God, applying the truths they hear to their own lives.  

We love to connect with and support families as they grow in faith together, helping children to realise their value and the part they play in God’s Big Plan for the world!
