On the **last Sunday of each month**, we start with refreshments at 10.00am, followed by a shorter service with a focus on worship for all ages at 10.30am. We call these our Mosaic Sundays, reflecting the fact that our church is made up of individuals who are all precious and unique  – but like individual pieces of pottery or glass, each time we come together we make up a beautiful and colourful mosaic! It’s a great opportunity to celebrate and learn together as a church family.
