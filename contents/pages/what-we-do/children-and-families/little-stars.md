Little Stars is a play group for parents and carers of pre-school children. Run by our Children’s Worker, Pip Perrin, and a team of volunteers the group provides a structured playtime on Thursday mornings during term, between 10.00-11.30am. 

There is a minimum donation of £1.50 per child per session, and this includes tea or coffee for the adults and a craft activity, drinks and snacks for the children.  You are more than welcome to come along and try out Little Stars – but just a little tip, get there early as places are limited and there’s often a queue! 

To find out more, you can contact <info@jubileechurch.co.uk>. And to keep up to date with the latest news from us, [like Little Stars on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/littlestarsbromley)
