Little Stars runs on **Thursday mornings** during term, between 10.00-11.30am and provides a warm welcome for parents and carers of pre-school children. There are lots of different toys to enjoy, a role play area, craft station and when the weather is good our patio area is open with ride on toys and a sand pit!  Song time at the end of our time together is always popular! 

There is a minimum donation of £1.50 per child per session, and this includes tea or coffee for the adults and a craft activity, drinks and snacks (fruit and biscuits) for the children.  You are more than welcome to come along and try out Little Stars – but we recommend arriving early as places are limited and there’s often a queue!
