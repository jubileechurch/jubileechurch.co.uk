If you would like to join us at our church service on a Sunday morning, you’ll be given a warm welcome. There’s no obligation – you can just come along and take part in as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. We meet at 10am every week. During all of our regular meetings we provide separate activities for [children](/pages/what-we-do/children-and-families/#sundays) and [young people](/pages/what-we-do/youth/#sundays). 

Walk past the Jubilee Centre on a Sunday morning and the chances are that you may see or even hear us spending time together worshipping God. Our friendly and informal services are followed by the chance to chat over a cup of tea or coffee. We sing songs to praise and thank God, pray together and individually and learn more about living our lives for God.  

Children spend some of the morning in their [own groups](/pages/what-we-do/children-and-families/#sundays), learning stories from the Bible and having fun with arts and crafts. A supervised crèche is also available where little ones can play together in a relaxed and fun environment. A couple of times a month, we also have [separate activities for teenagers](/pages/what-we-do/youth/#sundays), with the opportunity to explore Christianity in the context of the issues they face as young adults today.
