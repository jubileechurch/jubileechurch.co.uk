Every month, we have what we call ‘Café Church’. Starting at 10:00am, the set up in the Jubilee Centre is a bit different. Groups of chairs are put around small tables, with refreshments, biscuits, croissants and fruit available throughout the service. Although we do spend time worshipping together during Café Church, the focus is often on group discussions and activities where we can share with and encourage one another.
