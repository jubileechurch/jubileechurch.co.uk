On the last Sunday of each month, we start with refreshments, followed by a shorter service with a focus on worship for all ages. We call these our Mosaic Sundays, reflecting the fact that our church is made up from individuals of different ages, backgrounds and personalities â€“ but like individual pieces of pottery or glass, each time we come together we make up a beautiful and colourful mosaic! These services tend to be a little bit different, but are always lots of fun and very refreshing.
