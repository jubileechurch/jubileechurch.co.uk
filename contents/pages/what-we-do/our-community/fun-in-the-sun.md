Our annual Fun in the Sun event, usually held over the August Bank Holiday weekend, is organised in conjunction with [Bromley Common Churches Together](/pages/who-we-are/#our-connections). Fun in the Sun is a free event for the local community and is held in Whitehall recreation ground in Southlands Road, just a minute’s walk from the Jubilee Centre. It’s a great afternoon for all the family, with live music, games, face painting, bouncy castles, a BBQ and plenty of refreshments.
