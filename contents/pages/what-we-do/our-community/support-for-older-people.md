A small team of volunteers from Jubilee Church provide support in helping to meet the social and spiritual needs of older people in our community. We do this through a regular programme of informal visits to local residential care homes.

Our volunteers offer friendship and support to residents through activities such as music or reading, or just a good old chat! We also work with other local churches to arrange regular Sunday services at the care homes.
