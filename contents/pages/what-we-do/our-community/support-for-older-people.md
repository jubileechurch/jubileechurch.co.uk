A small team of volunteers from Jubilee Church provide support in helping to meet the social and spiritual needs of older people in our community. We do this through a regular programme of informal visits to local residential care homes run by Mission Care, an interdenominational Christian organisation providing high quality residential and nursing care for older people.

Our volunteers offer friendship and support to residents through activities such as music or reading, or just a good old chat! We also work with other local churches to arrange regular Sunday services at the care homes.
